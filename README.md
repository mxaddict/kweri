# kweri

This is a simple CLI program that searches in your favorite search engine using your
system's default browser.

## Usage

```sh
# Search your favorite engine for "I like turtles"
kweri "I like turtles"

# returns help text
kweri --help

# returns the version
kweri --version
```

## Why build this?

I found that I was wanting to do a google or duckduckgo search from my cli more often
and the process of tabbing out into the browser and clicking the address bar was
getting annoying.

## Configuration

[kweri](#kweri) will create a default config file with sample search engines and
tell you where the config file was created on first use.

## Tips

Create an alias for [kweri](#kweri) to something like `q`.

```sh
alias q=kweri
```

This allows you to quickly search in the cli like so.

```sh
q "I like turtles"
```
